## Reference

These are websites I used to aid me in learning different syntax and different methods, functions, etc for Javascript.

> - [Developer Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) || Learn a good amount of methods and functions here.
> - [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/) || jQuery Methods and uses were referenced here.
> - [StackOverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com/) || Most issues I had were resolved from looking at other people's problems.
> - [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/template-literals/) || CSSTRicks has an article on Template Literals, I used this as a guide to create my own.

These websites aid me in creating this README.
